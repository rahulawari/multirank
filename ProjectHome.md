This package uses a novel technique to calculate "reputation" or influence of users and artifacts in semantic social networks. Adapting the PageRank algorithm to the relational schemas of typical social network applications, it allows the developer to define via minimal rules the ways in which the reputation of one user or artifact is likely to influence another, and to obtain a mechanical, global ranking which reflects those rules, in combination with the link structure of the network.  The MultiRank API provides a convenient way to add reputation-based functionality to existing Java-based community applications.
